 A app that can help track your menstruation and calculate possible fertile days also allows you to take notes and document symptoms
## Overview
This application would ask you Permission to grant access for Internet and Storage.
once granted the app would use this privilage to write for personalize notes and create a backup file for the data's that the user inputed. which you can restore anytime and use the Internet access for logging in accounts

## Requirements
*   Android Studio Chipmunks version or above (installed on a Mac, Linux, or Windows machine)
*   Android device in developer mode (see [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options) for reference) with USB debugging enabled
*   USB cable (to connect Android device to your computer) and change the USB configuration from "Charging only" to Media transfer protocol or known as MTP at your Android device

## Features
### 1. Create Calendar Entry 
- Tells you when you're fertile or infertile. Click any Day to mark when your period starts. you can always change the length of the period at settings (preference option).
for example your period starts at july 10 and August 18 so you touch and marked it at the app then it'll show you these colors such as Red, Blue, and Yellow where Red means the Days of your period, Blue means Fertile days and Yellow means Infertile days (See the Help option for further information)

### 2. Create/Update Details
- Helps you Add or Updates the details of any clicked days. Click any Day to add or update details. for example i clicked july 13 which a window pops up saying should i delete a period mark but for now we ain't deleting something so right now we click the "create/update details" button then it redirects you to a Details area. here you can modify the day if you had a period or not or change the intensity of your period and add a note or simply check the circles for events, mood, and symptoms but for now let's fill up the mood instead (see image below)

### 3. Period History
- Tells you when each period starts and tells you what is your last cycle. basically reveals all the days you clicked to mark a Period, as seen here where i clicked july 10 and aug 18 earlier for demonstration. also acts as an Auto-search when you click one of the list it'll redirect you to that specific day or month.

### 4. Report
- almost similar to Period History but tells you all the details you inputted instead. as seen here where i add details earlier at July 13 for the mood such as Tired, Sad, Grumpiness, and being Edgy (This can further expand depends the amount of detail you put)

### 5. Backup
- Saves all the data such as the Calendar entries, the Details,, History and Report in your phone incase you accidently cleared the data of the app (See the Demo video for instructions and further informations)

### 6. Restore
- like the name suggests, restores data by finding the folder where you put the backup folder and file (again, see the Demo video for instructions and further informations)
![restore](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109476616/179828742-b2a4eb2a-7d6e-4430-875b-d149986112cb.png)

### 7. Custom Note
- Incase you had no internet, you can always write a note for later use and it will be saved at your phone's internal storage as a PDF file
